# 📌Infotact Projects
This repository contains two Python-based projects focused on security, productivity, and human–computer interaction. Both projects demonstrate practical application development using modern Python libraries, GUI frameworks, and secure programming practices.

# 🔐 Secure Password Generator & Rich Text Editor (Tkinter)

   A desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter that integrates a secure password generator with a feature-rich text editor into a single, intuitive interface. The project enhances productivity while promoting strong cybersecurity practices.
   
# ✨ Features
   
1.Cryptographically secure password generation using Python’s secrets module

2.Customizable password options (length, character sets)

3.Rich text editor with:
   Bold, italic, underline formatting
4.Font style and size customization
5.Text alignment
6.Clipboard operations (copy, paste, cut)
7.Event-driven GUI design
8.Modular and maintainable application architecture

# 🛠 Technologies Used

1.Python
2.Tkinter
3.secrets module

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

1.GUI development using Tkinter
2.Secure random number generation
3.Event-driven programming


# 🎤 Voice-Based Attendance System (KivyMD)
A voice-based attendance system that allows users to mark attendance by simply speaking names. The system uses speech recognition for hands-free input and stores attendance records in a MySQL database with timestamps.

# ✨ Features

1.Voice-controlled attendance marking
2.Intuitive and modern UI using KivyMD
3.Speech recognition for name detection
4.Real-time attendance storage with timestamps
5.Efficient and user-friendly attendance tracking

# 🛠 Technologies Used

1.Python
2.KivyMD
3.Speech Recognition
4.MySQL

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

> Voice-based user interaction
> Mobile-friendly UI design with KivyMD
> Database connectivity and real-time data storage
> Practical implementation of speech recognition
> Modular software design
