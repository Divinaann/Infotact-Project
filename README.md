# 📌Infotact Projects
This repository contains two Python-based projects focused on security, productivity, and human–computer interaction. Both projects demonstrate practical application development using modern Python libraries, GUI frameworks, and secure programming practices.

# 🔐 Secure Password Generator & Rich Text Editor (Tkinter)

   A desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter that integrates a secure password generator with a feature-rich text editor into a single, intuitive interface. The project enhances productivity while promoting strong cybersecurity practices.
   
# ✨ Features
   
> Cryptographically secure password generation using Python’s secrets module
> Customizable password options (length, character sets)
> Rich text editor with:
   Bold, italic, underline formatting
> Font style and size customization
> Text alignment
> Clipboard operations (copy, paste, cut)
> Event-driven GUI design
> Modular and maintainable application architecture

# 🛠 Technologies Used

> Python
> Tkinter
> secrets module

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

> GUI development using Tkinter
> Secure random number generation
> Event-driven programming


# 🎤 Voice-Based Attendance System (KivyMD)
A voice-based attendance system that allows users to mark attendance by simply speaking names. The system uses speech recognition for hands-free input and stores attendance records in a MySQL database with timestamps.

# ✨ Features

> Voice-controlled attendance marking
> Intuitive and modern UI using KivyMD
> Speech recognition for name detection
> Real-time attendance storage with timestamps
> Efficient and user-friendly attendance tracking

# 🛠 Technologies Used

> Python
> KivyMD
> Speech Recognition
> MySQL

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

> Voice-based user interaction
> Mobile-friendly UI design with KivyMD
> Database connectivity and real-time data storage
> Practical implementation of speech recognition
> Modular software design
