# 📌Infotact Projects
This repository contains two Python-based projects focused on security, productivity, and human–computer interaction. Both projects demonstrate practical application development using modern Python libraries, GUI frameworks, and secure programming practices.

# 🔐 Secure Password Generator & Rich Text Editor (Tkinter)

   A desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter that integrates a secure password generator with a feature-rich text editor into a single, intuitive interface. The project enhances productivity while promoting strong cybersecurity practices.
   
# ✨ Features
   
1. Cryptographically secure password generation using Python’s secrets module

2. Customizable password options (length, character sets)

3. Rich text editor with:
     Bold, italic, underline formatting
4. Font style and size customization
   
5. Text alignment

6. Clipboard operations (copy, paste, cut)

7. Event-driven GUI design

8. Modular and maintainable application architecture

# 🛠 Technologies Used

1. Python
   
3. Tkinter
   
5. secrets module

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

1. GUI development using Tkinter
   
3. Secure random number generation
   
5. Event-driven programming


# 🎤 Voice-Based Attendance System (KivyMD)
A voice-based attendance system that allows users to mark attendance by simply speaking names. The system uses speech recognition for hands-free input and stores attendance records in a MySQL database with timestamps.

# ✨ Features

1. Voice-controlled attendance marking
   
3. Intuitive and modern UI using KivyMD
   
5. Speech recognition for name detection
   
7. Real-time attendance storage with timestamps
   
9. Efficient and user-friendly attendance tracking

# 🛠 Technologies Used

1. Python

2. KivyMD

3. Speech Recognition

4. MySQL

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

1. Voice-based user interaction

2. Mobile-friendly UI design with KivyMD
   
4. Database connectivity and real-time data storage
   
3. Practical implementation of speech recognition
   
5. Modular software design
